### Learning Objectives

TODO: Please refer to the Learning Objectives section of the course web site to review
the learning objectives for both Allegheny College and the Software Engineering course.

#### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the during this module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge
When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:

When I was working on `fill in the name of a project development task`, I
made a mistake when I `explain details about the mistake`.

I did not understand `explain what you did not understand`.

Now I know `explain what you know`.

I revealed the gap in my understanding by `explain what steps you took to
identify the gap`.

Now I know `explain what you now know`.

To demonstrate my improved understanding of this project development skill, I will
`explain what steps you will take now that you understand the learning
objective`.

#### Give a learning objective that connects to project experiences but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated project skill.

TODO: Provide a direct link to course web site section that describes the learning
objective so that it is clear you have read this section of the syllabus and
